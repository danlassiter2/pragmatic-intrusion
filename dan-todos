check all stimuli to make sure coded correctly

check all QUDs

run through each condition and check for bugs, look at output data

=======

before running:

check estimate of time in info sheet

make sure all relevant variables are being recorded
    notably, QUD manipulation in by-trial data
    if global QUD = none, then make every trial's data 'none'

can pay £1.2 per participant. or, need 2 exp versions: lhood and other. 
        in pilot: lhood took 
              Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
            3.624   5.280   6.477   8.094   8.551  26.554
        vs others
               Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
            1.998   3.471   4.307   5.153   5.770  32.659
        so, pay lhood participants more - at $9/hr that should be
            lhood: £1.2   if 8 minutes
            others: £0.90 if 6 minutes
