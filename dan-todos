record QUD manipulation in by-trial data
    if global QUD = none, then make every trial's data 'none'

check all stimuli to make sure coded correctly

check Sabine's QUDs to make sure they work
    note esp "not sure about this one" Qs

change participant ID to live on lines 193-6

can pay £1.2 per participant. or, need 2 exp versions: lhood and other. 
        in pilot: lhood took 
              Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
            3.624   5.280   6.477   8.094   8.551  26.554
        vs others
               Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
            1.998   3.471   4.307   5.153   5.770  32.659
        so, pay lhood participants more - at $9/hr that should be
            lhood: £1.2   if 8 minutes
            others: £0.90 if 6 minutes


stims - the following occurs twice
    ana "The triangle is pink too."

go through images - give them longer identifiers and use string.includes() method to match multiple stims to the same image
    make sure this doesn't break anything in the likelihood trials!
