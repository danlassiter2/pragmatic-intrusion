change btw condition randomization - to get optimal spread - lines 200ff
    how many per condition for binary, slider?

binary lhood? for parity

l261ff - we are only using 6 stims for the pilot? if so need to expand
    yes - changes will interact with make_test_trial(), see lines 565ff

349ff - reduce ranges in training trials

change to preload all images
    i.e. just list all images in 'images_to_preload'

add QUD manipulation
    by participant: yes or no (target 25% no in order to get similar data quantity for each condition)
    within: first, second, or both-targeting

record QUD manipulation in by-trial data
  if global QUD = none, then make every trial's data 'none'

add QUDs to training for relevant participants??
